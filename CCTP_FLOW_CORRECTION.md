# CCTP Flow Correction: User Wallet Integration

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Identified

### Senior Blockchain Dev: *"You're absolutely correct!"*
*"The CCTP bridge cannot work through the agent wallet because:

1. **User Signature Required**: CCTP transactions require user signatures for approval and burn operations
2. **Agent Wallet Limitation**: Agent wallets can only execute pre-authorized operations, not arbitrary CCTP transactions
3. **Security Model**: CCTP requires direct user interaction for security and compliance

The correct flow should be:
1. User connects EVM wallet (Base Sepolia)
2. User selects cross-chain strategy (EVM + Aptos)
3. Backend generates allocation with Aptos protocols
4. **User directly executes CCTP bridge** from their wallet
5. **User deposits to Aptos vault** after bridge completion
6. Aptos vault receives and tracks funds
7. Frontend shows cross-chain portfolio

We need to fix the CCTP integration to work with user wallets directly."*

### Junior Blockchain Dev: *"Let me fix the implementation!"*
*"I need to update:

1. **CCTP Bridge Component**: Make it work with user's wallet directly
2. **Backend Integration**: Remove agent wallet CCTP execution
3. **Frontend Flow**: Update the user flow to handle direct CCTP execution
4. **Strategy Execution**: Separate EVM and Aptos execution flows

The user should:
- Execute CCTP bridge themselves (user signs transactions)
- Deposit to Aptos vault after bridge completion
- Backend tracks the cross-chain allocation

Let me fix this now!"*

### Hackathon Winner: *"Good catch! Let's fix this quickly!"*
*"This is a critical fix that needs to be done before the demo. The corrected flow is:

**Corrected User Flow:**
1. User connects EVM wallet (Base Sepolia)
2. User selects cross-chain strategy (EVM + Aptos)
3. Backend generates allocation with Aptos protocols
4. **User executes CCTP bridge directly** (user signs all transactions)
5. **User deposits to Aptos vault** after receiving USDC on Aptos
6. Aptos vault receives and tracks funds
7. Frontend shows cross-chain portfolio

This is actually better UX because:
- User has full control over their funds
- No complex agent wallet CCTP integration
- Clear separation of concerns
- More secure and transparent

Let's implement this fix!"*
